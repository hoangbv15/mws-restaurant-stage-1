### To build

Install npm dependency packages by running

`npm i && npm run build-images`

The command `npm run build-images` will turn the original images in `public/img_src` into compressed images optimised for the web in `public/img`

Note that if you get image not found errors while running this website, it is likely due to this command not being run successfully before serving.

### To serve

Run this command to spin off a http server on port 8000:

`npm run serve`
